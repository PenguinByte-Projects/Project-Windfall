# What is Project Windfall?
Project Windfall is an immutable, independently-based GNU/Linux distribution with with an emphasis on security, modularity, reliability, and convenience.

# Disclaimer
Project Windfall is a work in progress, currently a concept. I am still learning Rust and learning how to build a distro in my free time, so there is no build of Project Windfall available for download at this moment, and it maybe a while till there is. The name "Project Windfall" is also just a placeholder name and will not be used in the official releases. We already have a name ready for then but do not want to disclose it yet.

# What features will Project Windfall include?
1. Project Windfall will be fully immutable, allowing for atomic upgrades and rollback in case an update or modification damages the system.
2. Project Windfall will have a read-only directory dedicated to core system programs, and a writable directory for all the other programs, allowing for direct native installation and management of traditional packages without the need for any subsystems.
3. Project Windfall will include the GNOME desktop environment by default, although that is changeable, and will leverage the full potential of systemd, for example using systemd-boot instead of GRUB. This also means that if you dislike systemd, Project Windfall may not be the distro for you.
4. Project Windfall will also use its software center instead of GNOME Software. This new software center will provide easy graphical installation of all supported packaging formats including tar packages, the ability to compile and manage source packages, the ability to manage all packages installed on the system, and some other features.
5. Project Windfall will include its own powerful and easy-to-use package manager, avpkg.
6. Project Windfall's package manager and other programs will be written in the fast and secure Rust programming language.

# What is the goal of Project Windfall?
The goal of Project Windfall is to create my vision of the ideal GNU/Linux distribution. A GNU/Linux distribution with all codecs and drivers preincluded out of the box, and an "it just works" experience, as well as including a robust security system and my vision of immutability.

# Who is Project Windfall targeted towards?
Project Windfall is meant for everyone. Initially, Project Windfall will only have one desktop release geared towards normal users, but there will be many other versions of Project Windfall coming out when it grows bigger.

# Editions
Project Windfall will have a few editions, those of which include the following:
1. Windfall Workstation: A beautiful and easy-to-use desktop for everyday use. This will be the initial Project Windfall release.
2. Windfall Server: A free operating system for servers, supercomputers, and embedded devices.
