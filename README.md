# What is Project Windfall?
Project Windfall is an immutable, independently-based GNU/Linux distribution with with an emphasis on security, reliability, and convenience.

# Disclaimer
Project Windfall is currently a concept, and if everything goes to plan, soon a work-in-progress. There is no build of Project Windfall available for download at this moment, and it maybe a while till there is. The name "Project Windfall" is also just a placeholder name and will not be used in the official releases. We already have a name ready for then but do not want to disclose it yet.
